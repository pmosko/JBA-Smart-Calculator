## Password Hacker
All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project you’ll wear the hat of a real hacker. You must connect to a secret server without knowing the password. Your task is to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.

## Smart Calculator
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.
